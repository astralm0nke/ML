# Image-Classification-Neural-Network
This is a multi-layer perceptron in vanilla python that identifies handwritten digits from 0-9.
It uses the MNIST Handwritten Numbers Dataset and Jupyter Notebook.
2 epochs, 1 hidden layer with 200 nodes, sigmoid activation.
There's no keras, tensorflow, etc., just vanilla python.
Z=about 95% accuracy.
Based on the book "Make Your Own Neural Network" by Tariq Rashid, an excellent intro into the math and code for machine learning with python that I used to first learn about the subject. Prob one of the best resources I've personally found on the subject for people learning python.
Enjoy!:)
